# AgentAuth — Executive Summary

## One-Liner
**AgentAuth is the authorization layer for autonomous AI agents — the "Okta for AI."**

---

## The Problem
AI agents are becoming autonomous. Claude uses computers. GPT executes code. Agents book flights, deploy infrastructure, and process refunds. But there's no standardized way to control what they can do.

**78% of enterprises cite "lack of control" as their #1 barrier to AI agent adoption.**

---

## The Solution
AgentAuth provides permission infrastructure for AI agents:

- **Consent Management** — Define what each agent can do
- **Policy Enforcement** — Real-time allow/deny/escalate decisions
- **Limits** — Cap spending, rate limit actions, restrict scope
- **Human-in-the-Loop** — Route sensitive actions for approval
- **Audit Trail** — Cryptographic proof of every agent action

**5-minute integration. One API call to authorize any agent action.**

## Market
- **TAM:** $12.4B (AI governance & compliance by 2028)
- **SAM:** $4.2B (AI authorization & access control)
- **Timing:** EU AI Act requires human oversight. Enterprises need guardrails now.

## Business Model
SaaS + usage-based pricing:
- Free: 1,000 actions/mo
- Startup: $49/mo (10K actions)
- Pro: $199/mo (50K actions)
- Enterprise: Custom (unlimited + SLA)

**Target ACV:** $15K | **LTV:CAC:** 15:1 | **Gross Margin:** 85%

## Traction
- MVP live (Nucleus dashboard + API)
- SDKs: JavaScript, Python
- [X] waitlist signups
- Design partners in pipeline

---

## Competition
| Competitor | Gap |
|------------|-----|
| Okta/Auth0 | Human identity, not agent actions |
| Guardrails AI | Prompt validation, not action authorization |
| In-house | 6+ months vs. 5-minute integration |

## The Ask
**Raising:** $2.5M Seed
**Use:** Engineering (60%), GTM (25%), Ops (15%)
**Milestone:** $500K ARR, 50 customers, SOC2 in 18 months

---

## Why Now?
1. **Autonomous agents are shipping** — Every major AI lab building agent capabilities
2. **Regulation is coming** — EU AI Act, SEC scrutiny on AI decisions
3. **Enterprises are stuck** — Can't deploy agents without authorization layer
4. **No incumbent** — First-mover advantage in defining the category
