## Cold Email Template #1 (To Martin Casado)

**Subject:** The authorization layer for AI agents (Okta for AI)

Hi Martin,

AI agents are shipping—Claude uses computers, GPT executes code, agents book flights and deploy infrastructure. But there's no standardized way to control what they can do.

We're building **AgentAuth**: the authorization layer for autonomous AI agents.

**The problem:** 78% of enterprises cite "lack of control" as their #1 barrier to AI agent adoption. There's no Okta for AI.

**Our solution:** One API call to authorize any agent action—with consent management, spending limits, human-in-the-loop approvals, and cryptographic audit trails.

**Why now:** EU AI Act requires human oversight. Every AI lab is shipping agents. Enterprises need guardrails yesterday.

**Traction:** MVP live, [X] waitlist signups, design partners from [companies].

I'd love 15 minutes to show you how we're becoming the trust layer between AI agents and the real world.

## Cold Email Template #2 (To Anjney Midha)

**Subject:** Seed raise: Authorization infrastructure for AI agents

Anjney,

Quick context: I saw your investment thesis on AI infrastructure and wanted to share what we're building.

**AgentAuth** = Okta for AI agents.

As AI agents get autonomous (Claude Computer Use, GPT Actions, etc.), someone needs to define what they can do, enforce limits, and maintain audit trails for compliance.

That's us.

**Why it matters:**
- $12B+ market in AI governance by 2028
- EU AI Act mandates human oversight
- Enterprises blocked from deploying agents due to compliance concerns

**What we've built:**
- Authorization API (<50ms latency)
- Policy engine (RBAC/ABAC for agents)
- Nucleus dashboard (admin control center)
- Audit logging with cryptographic proofs

**Ask:** 20-minute demo to show why we think this becomes critical infrastructure.

## Cold Email Template #3 (Shorter Version)

**Subject:** AI agents need permissions too

Hi [Name],

Every AI agent will need authorization before taking actions. We're building that layer.

**AgentAuth:** Consent management, spending limits, audit trails, human-in-the-loop — for AI agents.

Think Okta for AI. 5-minute integration. $12B market.

15 min to show you?

## LinkedIn DM Template

Hi [Name] — saw your work on AI infrastructure at a16z. We're building the authorization layer for autonomous AI agents (Okta for AI). As agents get more autonomous, enterprises need guardrails. Would love to share a 2-min demo video if you're curious. No pitch, just want feedback from someone who gets the space.

---

## Twitter/X DM Template

Hey [Name], big fan of your AI infra takes. Building something in the space — authorization layer for AI agents (think: what can this agent do, spending limits, audit trails). Raising seed. Would love your take if you have 10 min. No worries if not — keep shipping great content.

---

## Warm Intro Request Template

**To:** [Mutual connection]
**Subject:** Intro request to [a16z Partner] re: AI infrastructure startup

Hey [Name],

Hope you're doing well! Quick favor to ask.

I'm raising a seed round for AgentAuth — we're building authorization infrastructure for AI agents (the "Okta for AI agents" as one of our advisors put it).

I noticed you're connected to [Partner name] at a16z. Given their focus on [AI/enterprise/infrastructure], I think there could be a strong fit.

Would you be open to making an intro? Happy to send a forwardable blurb.

No pressure if it's not a good fit — appreciate you either way.

Best,
[Your name]

## Forwardable Blurb (For Warm Intros)

[Partner name] —

Wanted to introduce you to [Founder name], founder of AgentAuth.

**Quick context:** As AI agents become autonomous (Claude Computer Use, GPT executing code, etc.), enterprises need a way to control what agents can do. AgentAuth is building the authorization layer — consent management, spending limits, audit trails, human-in-the-loop approvals.

Think "Okta for AI agents."

They have an MVP live, [X] waitlist signups, and are raising a seed round.

Given your focus on [AI infrastructure/enterprise], thought there might be a fit. I'll let [Founder] share more if you're interested.

## Follow-Up Sequence

### Day 3 (If No Response)
**Subject:** Re: [Original subject]

Hi [Name], just bumping this up. Happy to send a 2-min Loom demo if easier than scheduling a call.

### Day 7 (If No Response)
**Subject:** Quick update + demo link

[Name], recorded a quick demo: [Loom link]

Shows the authorization flow in action. Let me know if this resonates.

### Day 14 (Final Follow-Up)
**Subject:** Last note

[Name], I'll assume the timing isn't right. If AI agent infrastructure becomes relevant to your thesis, I'd love to reconnect.

In the meantime, we'll keep building. Following your work on [specific topic].

Best,
[Your name]

## What to Prepare Before Outreach

1. **Loom demo video** (2 min) — Show the product working
2. **One-pager PDF** — Executive summary formatted nicely
3. **Calendly link** — 15 and 30 min options
4. **Data room** (Google Drive/Notion)
   - Pitch deck
   - Financial model
   - Technical architecture
   - Customer discovery notes
   - Team bios

## Key Talking Points for a16z

1. **This is infrastructure, not an app** — Becomes the standard layer
2. **Developer-first GTM** — Free tier → Enterprise expansion (their playbook)
3. **Regulatory tailwind** — EU AI Act, SOC2 requirements driving adoption
4. **Network effects** — More agents → better policy templates → more agents
5. **Category creation** — First-mover in "AI agent authorization"

## Objection Handling

**"Why can't Okta/Auth0 do this?"**
> They're built for human identity. Agents don't have passwords or MFA. We're purpose-built for action-level authorization, spending limits, and AI-specific audit trails.

**"Why can't enterprises build this themselves?"**
> They can, and many will try. But it's 6+ months of engineering, no compliance story, and no network effects. We offer 5-minute integration with SOC2 compliance.

**"Is there enough market demand?"**
> 78% of enterprises cite lack of control as #1 barrier to AI adoption. Every AI lab is shipping agent capabilities. The demand is there — the solution isn't.

**"Why now?"**
> Autonomous agents shipped in 2024-2025 (Claude Computer Use, GPT Actions). Regulation is coming (EU AI Act). The window to become the standard is the next 18 months.

**"What's your moat?"**
> First-mover advantage, developer experience, and network effects from policy templates. Plus, authorization is sticky — once integrated, companies don't switch.
